    "# Tic-Tac-Toe Heuristic Function\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The heuristic function `e(p)` evaluates a Tic-Tac-Toe board position by estimating how favorable it is for a given player compared to the opponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used in **game search algorithms** such as **Minimax** and **Alpha–Beta Pruning** to guide decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Heuristic Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "The heuristic is based on the concept of **open winning lines**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **open line** is a row, column, or diagonal that:\n",
    "  - Contains **no pieces of the opponent**\n",
    "  - Can still potentially become a winning line\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Heuristic Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "e(p) = \\text{Number of open lines for Player} - \\text{Number of open lines for Opponent}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Line Considered\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **8 possible winning lines** in Tic-Tac-Toe:\n",
    "- 3 rows\n",
    "- 3 columns\n",
    "- 2 diagonals\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these lines is checked for openness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the Heuristic Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Count how many lines are **open for the player**\n",
    "2. Count how many lines are **open for the opponent**\n",
    "3. Subtract opponent’s count from the player’s count\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpretation of Heuristic Value\n",
    "\n",
    "| Heuristic Value | Meaning |\n",
    "|-----------------|---------|\n",
    "| Positive value  | Advantage for the player |\n",
    "| Negative value  | Advantage for the opponent |\n",
    "| Zero            | Balanced position |\n",
    "| Higher value    | Better winning potential |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### Empty Board\n",
    "- All 8 lines are open for both players  \n",
    "- Heuristic value = `8 − 8 = 0` (neutral)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Player Has More Threats\n",
    "- Player has more open lines than opponent  \n",
    "- Heuristic value is **positive**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opponent Dominates\n",
    "- Opponent blocks many lines  \n",
    "- Heuristic value is **negative**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Heuristic Is Effective\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple and fast to compute\n",
    "- Captures **positional advantage**\n",
    "- Suitable for **non-terminal states**\n",
    "- Works well with **Minimax search**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This heuristic provides a meaningful numerical evaluation of a Tic-Tac-Toe board by comparing the potential winning opportunities of both players.  \n",
    "It helps the AI select moves that **maximize future winning chances** while minimizing the opponent’s opportunities.\n"
