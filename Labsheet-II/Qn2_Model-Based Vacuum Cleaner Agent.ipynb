    "# Vacuum Cleaner Using a Model-Based Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A **model-based agent** improves the efficiency of an automated vacuum cleaner by maintaining an **internal model of the environment**.  \n",
    "Unlike a simple reflex agent, it uses both the **current percept** and **past information** to make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What the Model-Based Agent Does\n",
    "\n",
    "The model-based vacuum cleaner:\n",
    "- Remembers which locations are **Clean** or **Dirty**\n",
    "- Keeps track of its **current position**\n",
    "- Avoids unnecessary movements\n",
    "- Stops operating once all locations are clean\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in **better performance and higher efficiency**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent follows the cycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Perceive → Update Model → Decide → Act**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Perception\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent senses:\n",
    "- Current location (A or B)\n",
    "- Status of the current location (Dirty or Clean)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Internal Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent maintains an internal model:\n",
    "- Records cleanliness of each location\n",
    "- Updates the model after performing actions\n",
    "- Uses stored information to guide future actions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Decision Making\n",
    "\n",
    "Using its model, the agent:\n",
    "- Cleans only dirty locations\n",
    "- Moves only if another location is known to be dirty\n",
    "- Stops when both locations are clean\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible actions:\n",
    "- **Suck** – clean the current location\n",
    "- **Move Left / Move Right** – move to another location\n",
    "- **NoOp** – stop when the task is complete\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why the Model-Based Agent Is More Efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Uses Memory\n",
    "The agent remembers past percepts, leading to informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Avoids Redundant Actions\n",
    "It does not revisit already clean locations unnecessarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Saves Energy\n",
    "Fewer movements and actions reduce power consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Terminates When Goal Is Achieved\n",
    "The agent stops once all locations are clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Handles Partial Observability\n",
    "It can infer the state of unseen locations using its model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By maintaining an internal model of the environment, the model-based vacuum cleaner performs better than a simple reflex agent.  \n",
    "It achieves the cleaning goal efficiently with fewer actions and better decision-making.\n"
